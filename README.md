Description: <br>
Using Stack Overflow's annual developer survey, we compiled a small visualization using Data-Driven Documents (D3). The goal of this project is to visually show any trends within the Stack Overflow community. This is a competent dataset since it encompasses a good percentage of developers due to the nature of the website's purpose. <br>
